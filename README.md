The description of the dataset parameters given below.

<ol>
<li>Mo: the month 
<li>TE: Temperature degree 
<li>HU: Humidity degree
<li>WS: Wind Speed
<li>RR: Rain Rate 
<li>Y: class (1: threat, 0: Normal)

Note: the data represents the month number, as the exact day of the month was replaced with the month number due to the lack of a significant impact of the specific day on the classification. In contrast, the month plays an important role, as certain months of the year are more prone to rain and storms than others.
The dataset also includes:
<br>
•	Temperature, which affects thermal storms in the region and the rate of rainwater evaporation.
<br>
•	Humidity, which influences respiratory health in some individuals, evaporation levels, and visibility.
<br>
•	Wind speed, which is relevant for predicting storms and impacts visibility.
<br>
•	Finally, the rainfall amount, which is the most critical parameter related to flooding.
